How procedural content generation and random content generation adds replayability to video games. 


Abstract

Replayability is an essential requirement in video games. The games market is changing toward microtransactions or in-game purchases; 
meaning games titles need to have replay value to maintain a revenue stream for the organisation until new content release. 
This paper discusses the key elements of replayability: the experience, social aspects, difficulty, completion, competitive play, and randomisation.


The use of procedural content generation (PCG) techniques in game development significantly impact replayability. 
PCG and random content generation can be very impactful in game design when implemented correctly. It is, however, limited to specific game elements. 
It is most commonly used to create landscapes or textures. We look at the requirements of game levels by genre and how PCG can be used, if at all.
An application has been developed to demonstrate how randomisation and PCG is beneficial when designing a dungeon crawler. 
Through the use of PCG, we create a game level that is different to the previous one. 
The algorithm produces a broad range of levels, generating a wide variety of levels each time the game is played.
